                <p>A joint investigation with <a href="https://themanifoldfiles.org/gr/" target="_blank">The Manifold</a>. Utilizing <strong>machine learning</strong> and data analysis, we revealed that the public consultation for the contentious Greek joint custody law was compromised, as over <strong>63%</strong> (more than 7,000) of the supporting comments were mass-copied duplicates. This debunked the government's claims of record public consensus.</p>
