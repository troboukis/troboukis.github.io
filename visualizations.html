  This interactive visualization was developed with <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>D3.js</strong>, using a
  <strong>force-based simulation</strong> inspired by computational physics. Each circle represents one hour of air-quality
  measurements, while <strong>centering</strong> and <strong>collision forces</strong> pack thousands of points into compact,
  non-overlapping clusters.
</p>

<p>
  The graphic loads structured environmental data and maps particulate concentrations to a
  <strong>scientifically grounded color scale</strong>, reflecting air-quality threshold logic (normal–moderate–elevated).
  When the user switches between <strong>PM 2.5</strong> and <strong>PM 10</strong>, the visualization updates by
  reconfiguring the simulation forces and re-settling the swarm, enabling fast comparison across pollutants.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, the project combines <strong>web engineering</strong>, <strong>data visualization</strong>, and
  <strong>physics-inspired algorithms</strong> to translate thousands of hourly measurements into an accessible interactive
  narrative about urban air quality.
