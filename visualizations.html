  This interactive visualization was developed with <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>D3.js</strong>, using a
  <strong>force-based simulation</strong> inspired by computational physics. Each circle represents one hour of air-quality
  measurements, while <strong>centering</strong> and <strong>collision forces</strong> pack thousands of points into compact,
  non-overlapping clusters.
</p>

<p>
  The graphic loads structured environmental data and maps particulate concentrations to a
  <strong>scientifically grounded color scale</strong>, reflecting air-quality threshold logic (normal–moderate–elevated).
  When the user switches between <strong>PM 2.5</strong> and <strong>PM 10</strong>, the visualization updates by
  reconfiguring the simulation forces and re-settling the swarm, enabling fast comparison across pollutants.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, the project combines <strong>web engineering</strong>, <strong>data visualization</strong>, and
  <strong>physics-inspired algorithms</strong> to translate thousands of hourly measurements into an accessible interactive
  narrative about urban air quality.

  This visualization was built with <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>D3.js</strong>, using scientific color scales to
  encode hourly particulate measurements (<strong>PM 2.5</strong> and <strong>PM 10</strong>). Instead of generating thousands
  of HTML elements, the graphic renders the grid on a single <strong>HTML5 Canvas</strong>, which is significantly more efficient
  for large matrices of marks.
</p>

<p>
  The animation alternates between PM 10 and PM 2.5 by interpolating color values over time, applying principles from
  <strong>data encoding</strong> and <strong>perceptual mapping</strong> to help the viewer compare two environmental signals
  across the same hourly timeline. The implementation emphasizes <strong>mobile-first responsiveness</strong>, recalculating the
  grid geometry based on available screen width while preserving consistent scientific thresholds in the color domains.
